Hello this is a project ive been working on for half a year now. Its still a work in progress, but I wanted to show some progress and let the public see what Ive been working on. This game is a in a 2D side scroller made enitrely from SFML 3.0 in visual Studio C++. 

The code is also a little messy but when I have time I will polish it up

Rules:

You are a Medievil knight traversing a land riddled with enemies. The goal is to reach the end of the level where a boss is there to meet you. 

Controls:

- 'A' and 'D' are walking left and right respectively.

- 'W' is jump

- 'S' is to put up your shield and guard, blocking enemy projectiles and attacks.

- 'A + SPACE' or 'D + SPACE' is to sprint

- Left Click allows you to attack enemies with your sword

- Right Click allows you to roll making it so that your invulnerable during the animation

- If you press 'W' and press 'W' again near a ledge, you can hang off a tile, pressing 'W' a third time allows you to climb up ledges.

Known Bugs:
- Sometimes when you first start up the game, the knight will be placed in odd locations or be dead instantly, if that happens just exit out and start it up again.

- I added a sprint attack animation, but I haven't coded it in yet so it doesnt function as of now.

- The knight can rarely be uncontrollable after being hurt and attacking at the same time, if this happens just roll, it should reset the controls

- The boss at the end isn't entirely polished


Heres a video link to a 2 month old build of the game:
