Rules:

You are a Medievil knight traversing a land riddled with enemies. The goal is to reach the end of the level where a boss is there to meet you. 

Controls:

- 'A' and 'D' are walking left and right respectively.

- 'Space' is jump

- 'S' is to put up your shield and guard, blocking enemy projectiles and attacks.

- 'A + LShift' or 'D + LShift' is to sprint

- Left Click allows you to attack enemies with your sword

- Right Click allows you to roll making it so that your invulnerable during the animation

- If you press 'W' and press 'W' again near a ledge, you can hang off a tile, pressing 'W' a third time allows you to climb up ledges.

- Press R to heal using flasks

Known Bugs:
- I added a sprint attack animation, but I haven't coded it in yet so it doesnt function as of now
